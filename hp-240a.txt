HP VH240a 23.8-inch Full HD 1080p IPS LED Monitor 
with Built-in Speakers and VESA Mounting, 
Rotating Portrait & Landscape, Tilt, 
and HDMI & VGA Ports (1KL30AA) - Black

Sold by: Amazon.com Services LLC
Return eligible through Aug 13, 2020
$109.99
Condition: New

On inspection each display takes an hdmi cable and 19V power
from included adapter.  Think of getting a couple spare 19V
adapters.  

The mounts take four screws to the square VESA 
standard at 3-7/8" on the each of the four sides.
Very nice.

Now just need to get a dual VESA display mount.
